# MyWallet
1. Android app to track your transactions using the sms you receive for every card transaction
  You can tag specific things like, coffee shops, clothes, travel, etc. and have graphs for them
  
  End of the story

  No fancy features of setting up budget, tax returns, gf mobile bills etc.
  
2. on startup user is presented with option to parse existing sms to import expenses

3. all source and sink accounts are used by their defalut name - htere is a simple/intutive way to add tags to these accounts but app does not ask user to tag them in 1st go - focus on showing results as soon as you can - instead of configuring app for 10 mins
